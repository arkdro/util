search: Remote Graphical Login: Using Xvnc and gdm for One-Shot sessions

Need to bind x11vnc to screen instead of session

Starting manually (see README):

- create vnc password on the server
  might be unnecessary if no other users can connect to port 5900.
  # might be unnecessary if port 5900 only accepts connections on local interfaces

  x11vnc -storepasswd my_password .x11vnc_pw
  
- connect:
  ssh -t -L 5900:localhost:5900 user@host 'x11vnc -localhost -display :0'
  the cookie file ('/run/lightdm/root/:0' in this case) must be readable
  by the user which is used for the ssh connection, or connect with 'root@host',
  or use the systemd running service (see below).

Starting as a systemd service:
- x11vnc gives access to the login (greeter) screen of lightdm. A user is able to login.
- it's a one-time run. After a detach, x11vnc exits normally and does not restart.
  Tweak the service file if needed.

#+NAME: x11vnc systemd service
#+BEGIN_SRC config
# vnc-lightdm.service
[Unit]
Description=VNC Server (lightdm)
After=graphical.target

[Service]
ExecStart=bash -c 'x11vnc -auth /run/lightdm/root/:0 -display :0 -nopw'
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical.target
#+END_SRC

** use passwd

*** initial setup / after DM restart

1. during OS install: set pw1 (complex. Temporary. Only needed if using encrypted home)
   or disable pw completely for user1
2. login as other user: user2
3. disable login as user1 for any other way except local console
4. switch to user1
5. change pw from pw1 to pw2 (simple one)
6. login as user1 on local console
7. change pw from pw2 to pw3 (complex)
8. enable login as user1 for other ways

*** during work

1. login as other user: user2
2. switch to user1
3. terminate locker
4. switch from the locker screen to the local console
5. start locker

* Remotely start X session

** Using X

1. as root:
  X -nolisten tcp :1
  where ':1' is a first unoccupied displaynumber
2. as a user:
  DISPLAY=:1 xfce4-session

There are a lot of complaints:

xfwm4:2016): xfwm4-WARNING **: Unsupported GL renderer
xfsettingsd:2029): xfsettingsd-CRITICAL **: Failed to apply display settings
polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1:2053): polkit-gnome-1-WARNING **: Unable to determine the session we are in: No session for pid 2053
pa_context_connect() failed: Connection refused
light-locker:2067): ERROR **: session_id is not set
Xlib:  extension "DPMS" missing on display ":1.0
xfce4-power-manager:2064): xfce4-power-manager-WARNING **: Monitor is not DPMS capable

After 'logout': bunch of processes are still in memory.
