* issues

** common

- currently backup/restore of encrypted files/dirs is impossible

** specific version related

*** 0.2.9-1+b6

- changing a password (user calls 'passwd') makes protector's permissions to 644
  ignoring umask.
  Fixed in 0.3.3

* doc

https://github.com/google/fscrypt

* system wide preparation

** to allow users to change keys

- change permissions for policy and protector dirs (see /.fscrypt/*) to 01777
  (rwx for all, with sticky bit set)
- Optional:
  set the owner of a user policy and a user protector (/.fscrypt/policies/xxxx,
  /.fscrypt/protectors/xxxx) to the user

** to disallow users to change keys

- change permissions for policy and protector dirs (see /.fscrypt/*) to 0700
  (rwx for root only)
- change the ownership for policy and protector dirs to root

* home dir preparation

- create a user with a home dir
- create a new dir for the user. E.g. 'user.new'
- set owner of the new dir to the user
- user creates a protector for the new dir
- user moves everything from the old home dir to the new dir
- user renames the new dir to the home dir
