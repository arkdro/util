#+TITLE: On hiding metadata - manually reproduce CryFS

* Prepare the external layer

- setup gocryptfs (it needs -allow_other for losetup)
- fuse would needs -allow_root/-allow_other, which would need
  /etc/fuse.conf modification
- create a 5GB file on gocryptfs

* Prepare the internal layer

- setup losetup using that 5GB file
  losetup --find --show file.dat
- setup LUKS on the loop device from the previous step
  cryptsetup luksFormat --pbkdf-memory 4194304 --iter-time 8000 /dev/loopXXX
- make a filesystem on the LUKS device
- change reserved block count to 0
  tune2fs -r 0 xxxxxxxx
- mount the LUKS device to a working directory
- make sure a user have permissions to work with the working directory

* Work with data

- store the payload (e.g. a bunch of big files) in the working directory

* Finish the internal layer

- unmount the LUKS device from the working directory
- close the LUKS device
- detach the loop device

* Finish the external layer

- unmount the 5GB file

* Upload

- upload the gocryptfs encrypted directory to whatever place you want

* Notes

- losetup with a backing file on a go-fuse can produce a lot of weird
  log messages on writing. Although they seem harmless.
- use 'noatime' for go-fuse
- use 'noatime' for loopback mounted devices
