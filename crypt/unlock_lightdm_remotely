search: Remote Graphical Login: Using Xvnc and gdm for One-Shot sessions

Need to bind x11vnc to screen instead of session

Starting as a systemd service:
- x11vnc gives access to the login (greeter) screen of lightdm. A user is able to login.
- it's a one-time run. After a detach, x11vnc exits normally and does not restart.
  Tweak the service file if needed.

#+NAME: x11vnc systemd service
#+BEGIN_SRC config
# vnc-lightdm.service
[Unit]
Description=VNC Server (lightdm)
After=graphical.target

[Service]
ExecStart=bash -c 'x11vnc -auth /run/lightdm/root/:0 -display :0 -nopw'
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical.target
#+END_SRC

** use passwd

*** initial setup / after DM restart

1. during OS install: set pw1 (complex. Temporary. Only needed if using encrypted home)
   or disable pw completely for user1
2. login as other user: user2
3. disable login as user1 for any other way except local console
4. switch to user1
5. change pw from pw1 to pw2 (simple one)
6. login as user1 on local console
7. change pw from pw2 to pw3 (complex)
8. enable login as user1 for other ways

*** during work

1. login as other user: user2
2. switch to user1
3. terminate locker
4. switch from the locker screen to the local console
5. start locker

* Remotely start X session

** Using X

1. as root:
  X -nolisten tcp :1
  where ':1' is a first unoccupied displaynumber
2. as a user:
  DISPLAY=:1 xfce4-session

There are a lot of complaints:
